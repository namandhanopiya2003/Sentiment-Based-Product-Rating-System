This document highlights the advanced features added to the Sentiment-Based Product Rating System project. These upgrades enhance the system’s intelligence, usability, and diagnostic capability beyond simple sentiment prediction.

1. Root Cause Analysis Engine ==>
📌 Description: Beyond just identifying sentiment, the system now automatically detects underlying issues mentioned in customer reviews. This allows for granular diagnostic insights such as:

❌ late_delivery
📦 product_damage
❓ missing_manual
💸 overpriced
📷 misleading_images
📊 A multi-label classification model was trained using real-world review data, enabling detection of multiple issues per review.

2. Intelligent Improvement Suggestion System ==>
📌 Description: For every detected issue, the system now recommends specific improvement actions, providing actionable feedback to businesses. For example:

🔧 “Improve packaging”
🚚 “Use faster courier”
👨‍💼 “Train support staff better”
📜 “Include instruction manuals”
This is achieved using a second ML model trained to map review text to likely corrective suggestions.

3. Dual-Model Enhancement ==>
Two new models were added and trained:

🧩 cause_model.pkl – Multi-label classifier for root causes
💡 suggestion_model.pkl – Multi-label classifier for suggested improvements
These work in sync with the sentiment classifier, forming a full diagnostic pipeline from "customer voice" to "corrective action."

4. Unified Inference System ==>
📌 Description: The inference.py script has been fully upgraded to handle:

✅ Sentiment Prediction
🕵️ Root Cause Inference
🛠️ Suggestion Recommendation

---

All outputs are returned in a clean YAML format, making it easy to interpret ==>

✅ Result ==>
The project now acts as a complete customer feedback analyzer, not just a rating predictor — making it ideal for real-world deployment in e-commerce or service platforms.
